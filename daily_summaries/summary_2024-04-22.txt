    *   Brainstorming domain names to mimic legitimate Fortinet login pages.
    *   Troubleshooting issues with email display and delivery.

*   **Credential Harvesting:** Sharing cracked credentials and hashes from various sources.
*   **Infrastructure:** Discussing server infrastructure, paying for servers, and setting up hosting (cPanel).
*   **Workload Distribution:** Assigning tasks to different members: email template creation, panel setup, credential gathering.
*	**Ivanti (Pulse Secure)** Brief discussion around Ivanti attacks and whether they've been bruteforcing this.
*   **Citrix** Next focus on phishing campaigns after Fortinet.

**2. Key Decisions or Actions Planned:**

*   **Test and Refine Fortinet Phishing Campaign:** Testing the email delivery and landing page. They encounter formatting issues and possible blocking.

*   **Experiment with load execution** Load test exe's and dlls on victim machine with potential online bot.

**3. Notable Interactions Between Participants:**

*   **usernameyy and others discuss LockBit and ransomware trends:** Suggesting the team is falling behind by using a bad new strategy.
*   **usernamegg and lapa:** The primary discussion revolves around setting up the Fortinet phishing campaign. They bounce ideas off each other, troubleshoot problems, and divide tasks. A big conflict with whether or not they need cPanel.
*   **usernamegg delegating tasks:** He assigns tasks like writing text for emails to a "юрист" (lawyer) and asks others to collect/provide data.
*   **Nickolas and usernamegg:** Sharing attack tips and techniques. Nickolas expresses concern about targeting Citrix due to MFA, he suggests focus their effort on harvesting credentials from systems without MFA.

In summary, the group is actively developing a Fortinet phishing campaign, sharing data, and coordinating their efforts, which involves discussions around campaign strategy, technical implementation, and infrastructure management.
