Here is a summary of the cybercrime group's chat log:

1.  **Main Topics Discussed:**
    *   **Initial Validation and Filtering Issues:**  They are experiencing problems with their contact filtering process, as targets are not responding to them. They discuss potentially validating against Microsoft Teams ("тимсы").
    *   **Targeting Innophos:** They identified "INNOPHOS" as a potential target but determine the actual financial gain from it might be less than initially estimated. They plan to download data from this company.
    *   **Developing and Testing Loaders and Exploits:** A significant focus is on developing, testing, and troubleshooting a "loader" (malware delivery mechanism) and exploits for various vulnerabilities, primarily CheckPoint VPN RCE. They discuss bypassing Chrome's security measures.
    *   **Phishing and Credential Theft via Teams:** They are using fake Teams links for phishing.
    *   **Socks and RDP:** They discuss the use of socks proxies and RDP, mentioning unstable socks and the need for a more reliable solution.
    *   **Social Engineering with Callers:** They plan to integrate callers (people who make phone calls) into their operations to persuade targets to install software or provide credentials. They want someone with IT knowledge to make these calls.  The callers will pose as IT help desk or security experts.
    *   **MSIX Payload** The group also shifts focus into getting .msix payloads, in order to use msix installation to potentially load their payload.

2.  **Key Decisions and Actions Planned:**
    *   **Revise Contact Filtering:** They will change their contact filtering methods to improve response rates.
    *   **Data Exfiltration from Innophos:**  They will download data from Innophos and "ставит" (deploy) something later.
    *   **Exploit CheckPoint VPN RCE:** They plan to target hosts with CheckPoint VPN RCE vulnerability after collecting hosts.
    *   **Test the Amadey loader with New Crypter** To see if the payload will run without Chrome flagging it.
    *   **Bypass Chrome Security:** They're actively working on bypassing Chrome's security measures to allow the seamless delivery of their payload. One idea is making a similar .exe version of a known .exe used for the same purposes to be allowed on the white list for Chrome and other browsers. Also another approach is to take MS. Teams official installer and tamper with.
    *   **Acquire a Caller:** They will recruit an English-speaking individual with IT knowledge to make phone calls to potential targets. They also intend to set up all needed infrastructure, pay the caller a good salary, and give him bonus.
    *   **Use AnyDesk and Level.io** For better initial exploitation after gaining access using caller. Level.io also provides persistant remote access to exploited client and ability to extract other valuable information such as credentials.
    *   **Automate Credential Harvesting** the group plans to automatize cred harvesting from system after client provides them during scam
    *   **Load Testing** group plans to use new load testing approach to check systems stability

3.  **Notable Interactions Between Participants:**
    *   **@usernameugway and @usernamegg:** Frequent communication about various operational aspects, technical challenges, and strategic decisions, showing a leadership dynamic between the two.
    *   **@usernamess:**  Sharing potential targets, data breaches, and offering information on how to setup a system for mass mailing for a target
    *   **@usernameyy:** Works closely with GG but is tasked for a difficult task that requires him to change hours, leading to a desire for team to support his project.
    *   **@lapa:** Provides tech support, tests methods, and has frequent communication with GG to see how new testing is doing.

The chat log demonstrates a well-organized cybercrime group actively engaged in reconnaissance, exploit development, social engineering, and malware deployment.  They are adapting their techniques to evade detection and improve their success rate.
