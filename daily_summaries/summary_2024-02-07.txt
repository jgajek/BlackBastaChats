**1. Main Topics Discussed:**

*   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Discussion about a FortiSIEM vulnerability, searching for related exploits and sources.
*   **Data Collection & Processing:**  Gathering and managing email/password combinations, OWA data, and RD Web access. This includes building tools for searching these databases.
*   **Malware & Payload Testing:** Testing JS payloads, cryptors, and other malware against different AV solutions and email filters, including discussion about file types (exe, dll, js).
*   **Infection Strategies:** Experimenting with different methods to bypass email security (attachments, links, varying email content), targeting specific companies. Discussion to exploit with or without admin rights.
*   **Cobalt Strike:** Setting up and licensing Cobalt Strike servers, migrating beacons between servers. Issues with version compatibility.
*   **Network & Infrastructure:** Discussion about network infrastructure, server hardware, and potential hardware failures. Securing network access (Romann VLAN, migration to Last's DC).
*   **Negotiation:** Discussions about past payments, target response, and a new technique for targeted lock notes.
*   **Recruiting:** Recruting "чел" to help with cobalt strike themes and finding and coordinating with potential talent (e.g. with a "killer AV").

**2. Key Decisions or Actions Planned:**

*   **Developing an Exploit:** Attempt to create an exploit for a FortiSIEM vulnerability
*   **Improve data extraction tool:** Tool for searching base
*   **Credential Harvesting:** Data collection with OWA and other credentials.
*   **Testing new payloads:** Send JS payload as zip as attachment to test their success and detection rates.
*   **Create more unique links** to bypass current defenses.
*   **Customization** of Cobalt Strike, particularly theme
*   **Migrate Cobolt Strike** from 4.8 to 4.9 and from a unstable to stable server.
*   **Move hardware** from vulnerable datacenter.
*   **Make blog** on newly attacked organization

**3. Notable Interactions Between Participants:**

*   **`lapa` and `usernamegg`:** Frequent interaction around email filter testing, payload delivery, and data gathering.  `lapa` is testing the effectiveness of email delivery methods while `usernamegg` provides targets and tests from compromised systems. They also discuss the value of an account @ attluk.
*   **`muaddib6` and `usernamemm`:**  Collaboration on payload development and testing against AV.
*   **`usernamenn` and `usernamegg`:** Discussing about Cobalt Strike and other infrastructure
*   **`tinker` and `usernamegg`:** Discussing targets, negotiating, and a new approach to customize lock messages. `tinker` voices frustration about workload and a possible lack of context about the state of an operation.
